an automation platform

>libs:
    ex: fortune
    ex: notifications
>>plugins
    ex: notify when /dpt/ is up

so:
core; libs; plugins

SO WHAT DOES THE CORE NEED TO DO????2:
    >load libs into dict (?), make it available to plugins
    >load plugins & start their processes
    >make some variable space available to plugins
